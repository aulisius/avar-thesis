Our project describes about the accident report generation using GPS and GSM. We use a micro-controller to detect the accident based on feed from the Airbag deployment unit. The GPS receives the location of the vehicle which is sent to a remote server. The GPS data is used to communicate with the emergency services. We also design an smartphone application which can be used by the user to report false alarms. This is different than most works, which propose that the smartphone itself be used for accident report.

The remote server also issues push notifications to other users of the smartphone application.
