Road transportation has revolutionized the way we travel and transport goods. The increasing number of road users is proportionate with the increasing number of accidents, which could include fatalities. Reporting accidents has its challenges; mainly there exist communication gap in relaying location information to the operator. This, in turn, causes slow response to the situation. The objective of this project is to develop an integrative system that is able to speed up the process of reporting accidents. Our work includes a microcontroller-based low-cost Accident Reporting Unit (ARU) that contains a GPS positioning system and a GSM shield to sense and generate accidental events to a centralized server. Apart from that, it also collects the data and derives conclusions from it.
